# Invoiceme Architecture

Invoiceme Portal is sub-divided into `front-end` and `back-end` module. The stack details are mentioned below.

## Front-end
We are using Vue.js library for the front-end, by utilizing a template called `Vuexy`. You can find the latest documentation [here](https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-admin-dashboard-template/documentation/).

| Technology | Version |
| --- | ----------- |
| Vue.js | 2.* |

## Back-end

| Technology | Version |
| --- | ----------- |
| Laravel | 8.x |

## PROD & DEV Environments

Both PROD and DEV environments are hosted in AWS. Both environments are sharing the same EC2 instance called `Invoiceme` under the AWS region `London`.
If you want to access the server, you can connect to the `Invoiceme` instance in the `AWS console` under `EC2` services page.

The DNS records for both the invoiceme.app and invoiceme.dev are managed in the `AWS Route53`

We are using `Laravel Forge` to configure and deploy the changes to the PROD and DEV instance.
- PROD deployment is configured in a way where the changes are pulled from the `master` branch
- DEV deployment is configured in a way where the changes are pulled from the `develop` branch

The server is been configured using the `LEMP` stack
- `L` - Linux (Ubuntu 20)
- `E` - Nginx (Web server)
- `M` - MySQL 8.* (Database)
- `P` - PHP 7.4.*
